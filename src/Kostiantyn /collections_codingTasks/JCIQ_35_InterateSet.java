        Iterate a Set

        Create a program to iterate through a Set and print the values.
        The main focus here is to check your understanding of collection types and how Set is different from others

        Ex:
            input:
                 set: ["java", "selenium", "sql", "api"]
            output:
                java
                selenium
                sql
                api
     */
}
