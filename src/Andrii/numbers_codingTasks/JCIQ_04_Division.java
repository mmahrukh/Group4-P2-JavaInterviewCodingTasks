    Divide Without Division

    Create a method to divide two numbers without using the division operator.
    Display the division value as well as any remainder
        parameter: int, int
        return: void

    output format: num1 / num2 is resultValue with remainder $remainderValue

    edge cases:
        cannot divide by 0

    Ex:
        input: 6, 2
        output: 6 / 2 is 3 with remainder 0
    Test data:
        6, 2 -> 6 / 2 is 3 with remainder 0
        7, 2 -> 7 / 2 is 3 with remainder 1
        8, 3 -> 8 / 3 is 2 with remainder 2
        7, 0 -> Cannot divide by 0
        3, 5 -> 3 / 5 is 0 with remainder 3
