        Lovely Number

        Create a method that will count the lovely numbers with the given range.
        The parameters a and b are defined as the lower and upper bounds.
        A number is lovely if it contains fewer than three instances of any distinct digit

        Example of lovely numbers: 0, 100, 1232 and 9922
        Example of non-lovely numbers: 1000 (contains three copies of digit '0'), 33533 (contains four copies of digit '3').

        parameter: int, int
            A and B will be within the range: 0 - 100,000
        return: int

        Ex:
            Given A = 0, B = 0, your function should return 1, because o is
        lovely.

            Given A = 1, B = 111, your function should return 110, because
        the only integer in the range [1..111] that is not lovely is 111.

            Given A = 100000, B = 100000, your function should return 0,
        because 100000 is not lovely.
