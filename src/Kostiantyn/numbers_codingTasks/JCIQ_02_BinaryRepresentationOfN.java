    /*
        Binary Representation Of N

        Create a method to determine how many 1s are in the representation of the number in binary form
            parameter: int
            return: int

            The given n will be more than 0

        Ex:
            input: 6
            output: 2

            6 in binary is 110
            there are two '1' digits, so the output is 2

        Test data:
            6 -> 110 -> 2
            7 -> 111 -> 3
            4 -> 100 -> 1
            10 -> 1010 -> 2
            15 -> 1111 -> 4
            16 -> 10000 -> 1
