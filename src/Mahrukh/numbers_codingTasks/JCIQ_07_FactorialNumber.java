    Create a method that will accept an int number and return the factorial of that number.
        parameter: int

    -> 5 factional is: 5!

    Ex:
        input: 5
        output: 120

        -> all the positive numbers from the number, 5, are multiplied
            5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
    Test data:
        5 -> 120
        6 -> 720
        8 -> 40320
