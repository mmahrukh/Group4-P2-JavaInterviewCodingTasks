        Consecutive Numbers

        Create a method to print consecutive numbers from 1 to N,
        each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the
        word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers
        it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words.
        The given N value will be a positive integer.

            parameter: int
            return: void

        Example of a number being divisible by 2 & 3:
            when the number is 6 the output should be CodilityTest because 6 is divisible by 2 and 3

        Example of a number being divisible by 2 & 5:
            when the number is 10 the output should be Codi1ityCoders because 10 is divisible by 2 and 5

        Ex:
            input: 16
            output:
                1
