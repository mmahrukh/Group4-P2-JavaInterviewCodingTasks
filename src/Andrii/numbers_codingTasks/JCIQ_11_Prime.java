        Prime

        Create a method to check if the given N is a prime number
            parameter: int
            return: boolean

        A number is prime if it is only divisible by one and itself

        Ex:
            7 -> prime, because only 1 and 7 can be divided evenly
            6 -> not prime, because 6 is divisible by 2 and 3 also
