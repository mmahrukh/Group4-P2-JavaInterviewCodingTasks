        Time Series

        Create a method that will return the summation of the given time series.
        A time series will be a Map holding a time/value pair.
        Given two time series combine them together.
        When a time is matched in both series the values are combined

            parameter: Map<Integer, Double>
            return: Map<Integer, Double>

        Ex:
            input:
                 series A: {1=1.0, 2=1.5, 3=2.0}
                 series B: {2=1.0, 3=2.5, 5=1.0}
            output:
                 {1=1.0, 2=2.5, 3=4.5, 5=1.0}
